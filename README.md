# Tim de Groot

I’m a bachelor student studying Chemistry at the University of Amsterdam.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- (Computational) Astrochemistry
## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- Languages: Python
- Tech: Unix, Git, LaTeX
- Methods: Monte Carlo Simulations, Density Functional Theory
## 🚀 Projects
- [PAHMC](https://github.com/tim-degroot/PAHMC). A Monte Carlo model developped for my Bachelor Thesis to simulate scrambling and dissociation reactions in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to investigate isotopic effects.
- [What explains variation in land rents?](https://github.com/tim-degroot/data_project) A model developped for a Data Processing course to investigate variation in land rents.
- [yamlpaths](https://github.com/tim-degroot/yamlpaths). A Python CLI to create simple and beautiful reaction path energy diagrams using Gaussian16 files.
