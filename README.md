# Tim de Groot

I’m a bachelor student studying Chemistry at the University of Amsterdam  with a strong interest in Astrochemistry.

## 🔬 Research Interests
Astrochemistry & Molecular Spectroscopy
Monte Carlo Simulations of Molecular Processes
Computational Chemistry & Vibrational Analysis
## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
Languages: Python, Julia (learning)
Tech: Unix, Git, $\LaTeX$
Methods: Monte Carlo Simulations, Theoretical Modeling
## 🚀 Projects
- [PAHMC](https://github.com/tim-degroot/PAHMC) A Monte Carlo model developped for my Bachelor Thesis to simulate scrambling and dissociation reactions in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to investigate isotopic effects.
- [Data Processing](https://github.com/tim-degroot/data_project) A model developped for a Data Processing course to investigate variation in land rents.
